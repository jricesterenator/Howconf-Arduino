NOTES - What are we going to do?

(Overview)
-Later, I'm going to get into something cool you can do with LEDs.

-Realize you can make interesting things w simple inputs. A lot
of the cool projects out there don't use a lot of fancy hardware, they just use basic hardware
in a cool way.

NOTES - Why not Arduino?

-For RAPID PROTOTYPING. While seems cheap, it's actually a really
expensive microcontroller.
-Flashed code is bulky (due to imports) and requires a chip with a lot more memory 
than you'd normally need for doing the same things.

An Arduino will run you about $25, but you can buy plain AVR chips for about $1. And an
AVR programmer isn't much more than $10-15.

So for mass production or keeping your creation around as a final product without having
to sacrifice an arduino board, you might considering burning your own chips.

Today's project is going to build from basic LED blinking and (time allowing) it'll become a
Simon/Bop It-like game. If we don't get to the end in time, you should still be able to use
the schematics and lab answers I provide to make the game on your own time.

                        You all know buttons, right? Click..click. These are generally mechanical switches with
                        metal contacts that connect when you press.

                         (Talk about how to read input off these buttons)

                         We want to read the level when the switch is depressed. So you just hook the button up to
                         the Arduino input pin and you're golden, right?

                         What if you do that? ... BOOM.

                         What does a switch do? It connects the 2 pins. So, in this case, you're connecting
                         +5v to GND. It's going to GND through the switch and through the Arduino. You've created
                         shorts. A pair of shorts. You'll get a huge current draw coming through your USB port and
                         maybe something will start on fire.

                         What to do?

                         Add a resistor. A current limiting resistor like in Labs 1 & 2.

                         For button input, the resistor serves another purpose. How you wire it in has an effect on
                         the value you read. This is because it's acting as either a Pull-up or pull-down resistor.
                         (describe PU/PD)

                         All a button really does is state change. DOWN doesn't always mean on, and UP doesn't always
                         mean off. You know the name for buttons that are normally off, but go on when you press them?
                         Or that are normally on, but go off when you press?
                         ...Normally open (NO) / Normally closed (NC)

                         Pull-up/pull-down resistors let us create one or the other.

                    So how do you detect this? Store the previous value and compare it to the current. Make sure
                    to store the previous value as a variable OUTSIDE the loop(), otherwise it'll overwrite.
                    Give it a try and output "Button clicked" over serial.

                    When you have that working, notice anything strange? It might be registering extra clicks.

                        Buttons are mechanical devices and they work by 2 contacts coming together. Real world
                        things aren't perfect. There are variances in the pads and they can bounce against each other
                        when you press. This causes misreads and phantom button clicks.

                        There are hardware solutions with resistors and capacitors, but an easy software solution is
                        to delay reading the input to give the button time to settle down.
                        -delay() We'll use delay() at the end of the loop() and that'll be good enough.
                        -sampling delay - You can also store the time when you first read the button and only read
                         again after some amount of time has passed.

                         Edit your sketch and add a 100ms delay to the end. Are the phantom clicks gone?

                    linear or logarithmic. Logarithmic are generally used for things like hardware volume control.

                    The outer leads are usually +5V and GND, and the wiper in the middle is for the changing value.

                    At its core, digital IO is easy: set the pinMode() and use digitalRead(). What about Analog IO?
                    <next>

                    Here are common functions for analog IO.
                    ANALOG IN
                    To read analog, you've got to plug into one of the analog input pins on the other side of the board.
                    -You don't need to set the pinMode for analog IN
                    -Read using analogRead()

                    ANALOG OUT
                    To output analog,
                    -You use the digital pins and set the pinMode() to OUTPUT, just like digital.
                    --Except, you must plug into a PWM port (Pulse-width modulation). PWM ports can output the
                    range of analog values. The other ones only output 0/1 digital. If you write a range of values
                    to a non-PWM pin, it'll just scale that to 0/1.
                    -Output using analogWrite()

                    One consideration is that analog input returns a value 0-1023. However, output is 0-255.
                    If you want to do something like set the LED brightness to match the pot twist, you'll need to
                    adjust these values to be on the same scale. Arduino provides a convenience method for this called
                    map(). It converts a value from one scale to another.

                    You wire it up just like a button. The pins go to +5v/GND, there's a pull-up/pull-down resistor,
                    and you connect the arduino the same.

                    That's cool, but how about this? You can use an LED as a light sensor, too.
                    (Talk about why)

                    Interestingly, the LED color plays an important role in the light detection. For example,
                    RED seems to accept the most light. Visible and IR. Yellow and Green are more strict about
                    the light they let it.

                    Note that the values are as dramatic as with the photoresistor. That's ok,
                    but it just means there might be more noise to sift through when doing detection.

                    Now, we're going to use the LED-as-light-sensor concept and extend it to IR. A red LED catches
                    most light wavelengths, including IR, but it's sensitive to ambient light. By using an IR LED, we
                    can significantly limit the detection to the IR wavelengths. By emitting an IR signal from one
                    position, we can measure the amount of reflected light to detect an object's presence.

                    For the receiver, we're going to wire it up just like I did for the Red LED.

                    NOTE: While it primarily senses the light from straight on, the 'sensor' is very susceptible
                    to light from the sides. Because of this and for detection to work correctly, we need to
                    by block out the light from the sides (using heatshrink as a form and electrical tape to
                    block the light)

                    Go ahead, and wire up the receiver LEDs and output the value you read to serial.
                    Note: Make sure the angles are good for reflection. When you wave your hand over, the light value
                    should increase, then drop when you move your hand away.

                    When the pot changes, the light level outputted to serial should change. They're not connected,
                    why's this happening?

                    <next>
                    This is because of the analog input MUX'ing the chip does. It can't read all the
                    analog ports simultaneously, so it's quickly switching between the 2 inputs and there's some
                    bleedover in the read value.

                    <next>
                    One way to get around this, is to do like the code below.

                    <next>

                    change at all (as much) with the pot. Also, now you can activate the 3rd LED when the light value

                    You've already done the hard work of wiring everything up and reading/writing pins. With a little
                    game logic, what we've got here will become a Simon/Bop It-like game.

                    Since I assume you're all programmers and this is a class on hardware, I'm going to provide the
                    game logic.

                    <next>
                    First, there are a couple new things to cover: random number generation, importing 3rd party libraries,
                    and if you have them, buzzers and making noise.

                    Now that we can interact with the Arduino via serial console, let's do it more programmatically.
                    Python has a great module for this called pySerial.

                    (Who has it installed?)

                    Use `python -m serial.tools.list_ports` to list the available serial ports. On OSX, the Arduino
                    should be something like /dev/tty.usbmodem. On Windows, COM.
